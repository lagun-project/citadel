# FLP Impossibility Bypass

Formalizes how threshold-based consensus bypasses the FLP impossibility result.

## The FLP Impossibility (1985)

Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson proved:
> No deterministic consensus protocol can guarantee both safety AND liveness
> in an asynchronous network if even ONE node can crash.

The core problem: You cannot distinguish a crashed node from a slow one.

## How TwoGen/BFT Bypasses FLP

The key insight is changing the question:
- **FLP's question**: "Will node X ever respond?" (undecidable - halting problem)
- **Our question**: "Do I have enough signatures?" (decidable by counting)

### The Bypass Mechanism

1. **Threshold Aggregation**: Don't wait for specific nodes, wait for ANY 2f+1
2. **Quorum Intersection**: Any two quorums of 2f+1 from 3f+1 nodes overlap by f+1
3. **Honest Overlap**: With at most f Byzantine, intersection has honest node
4. **Flooding**: Continuous rebroadcast ensures eventual delivery

### Why This Works

FLP assumes protocols must wait for specific acknowledgments.
We never wait for individuals - we wait for a THRESHOLD.

## Key Results

* `threshold_consensus_safe` - Safety: No conflicting commits
* `threshold_consensus_live` - Liveness: Eventually achieves threshold
* `flp_bypass` - Main theorem: Deterministic consensus in async network
* `no_waiting_for_individuals` - We never wait for specific nodes

/-- Axiom: If two threshold signatures exist for same round, values equal

    Proof sketch:
    1. Both signers sets have ≥ 2f+1 members
    2. By quorum intersection, they overlap by ≥ f+1
    3. With ≤ f Byzantine, at least one overlap node is honest
    4. Honest nodes only sign one value per round
    5. Therefore both signatures are for the same value

/--
**FLP Bypass Theorem**

Our protocol achieves:
1. **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same outputs (threshold aggregation)
2. **Asynchronous**: No timing assumptions (flooding handles delays)
3. **Fault-tolerant**: Works with f crashes/Byzantine (quorum intersection)
4. **Safe**: No conflicting commits (honest overlap)
5. **Live**: Eventually terminates (flooding + threshold)

FLP said this was impossible. We did it by changing the question.

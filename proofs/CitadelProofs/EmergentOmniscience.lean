# Emergent Omniscience Theorem

The capstone theorem that ties SPORE + SPIRAL together.

## The Profound Claim

> **No node needs complete knowledge of the world
> for ALL nodes to have COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.**

This is not a contradiction. It's an emergent property.

## How It Works

1. Each node tracks only its 2-hop neighborhood (~400 peers)
2. SPORE syncs PeerInfo like any other data
3. Overlapping neighborhoods cover the entire mesh
4. The network stores itself, distributed

**The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.**

## Key Results

* `two_hop_bounded` - Each node stores O(k²) = O(400) peers
* `propagation_exponential` - Information spreads to N nodes in O(log N) rounds
* `emergent_omniscience` - Local storage, global access, zero steady-state cost
* `self_describing` - The network uses SPORE to learn its own topology

## The Beautiful Recursion

SPORE syncs data. PeerInfo is data. Therefore SPORE syncs knowledge of the network itself.

The network is:
- Self-describing (learns its own topology)
- Self-discovering (new nodes propagate automatically)
- Self-healing (departed nodes removed automatically)

No coordination. No central registry. Just SPORE + SPIRAL + mesh topology.

/--
**The Emergent Omniscience Theorem**

In a Citadel mesh:
1. Each node stores only O(k²) = O(400) peer records (2-hop neighborhood)
2. The union of all local knowledge = the entire mesh
3. SPORE sync propagates any new information in O(log N) rounds
4. At steady state, sync cost is zero

Therefore: Local storage, global access, zero maintenance cost.

**No node stores the world. The world stores itself, distributed.**

**Each node holds a piece. SPORE ensures the pieces stay synchronized.**

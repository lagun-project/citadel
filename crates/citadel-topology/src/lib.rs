//! Citadel Mesh Topology
//!
//! Hexagonal mesh topology with 20-connection invariant and SPIRAL self-assembly.
//!
//! # Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! The Citadel mesh uses axial hexagonal coordinates on a 3D layered grid.
//! Each node has exactly 20 connections:
//! - 6 planar neighbors (hexagonal grid)
//! - 2 vertical neighbors (layers above/below)
//! - 12 extended neighbors (diagonal connections across layers)
//!
//! # SPIRAL Self-Assembly
//!
//! Nodes join the network by claiming slots in a deterministic spiral pattern
//! starting from origin (0,0,0). First-writer-wins with 11-of-20 peer validation
//! ensures consistency without global coordination.
//!
//! # Formal Proofs
//!
//! All invariants are proven in Lean4. See `proofs/CitadelProofs/Topology.lean`
//! and `proofs/CitadelProofs/Spiral.lean`.

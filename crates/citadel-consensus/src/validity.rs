//! Slot validity through connection topology.
//!
//! A node doesn't "claim" a slot - it BECOMES a slot by having the right
//! connections. The slot identity emerges from the connection pattern.
//!
//! # Deterministic Contender Selection
//!
//! When multiple nodes contend for the same slot, neighbors select the winner
//! using a deterministic hash function - NO TIMESTAMPS, NO "FIRST WINS":
//!
//! ```text
//! winner = argmax_{c ∈ contenders} H(neighbor_id ‖ port ‖ contender_id ‖ epoch)
//! ```
//!
//! This is coordination-free but removes arrival order as an input.
//!
//! # Port Exclusivity
//!
//! For slot N with neighbor M, the port `toward(M, N)` binds to AT MOST ONE node.
//! Binding requires bidirectional mutual signatures (both endpoints sign).

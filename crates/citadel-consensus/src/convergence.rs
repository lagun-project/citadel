//! Convergent self-assembly: the mesh relaxes to SPIRAL topology.
//!
//! # Port Exclusivity Lemma
//!
//! For slot N with neighbor M, the port `toward(M, N)` can be bound to
//! AT MOST ONE node, and binding requires bidirectional mutual signatures.
//!
//! # Exclusivity Proof
//!
//! 1. Slot N has exactly 20 theoretical neighbors → 20 "toward-N" ports total
//! 2. If X occupies N, X binds ≥11 of those ports (with mutual signatures)
//! 3. Remaining unbound toward-N ports ≤ 9
//! 4. Any Y ≠ X can bind ≤ 9 toward-N ports ⇒ cannot reach threshold 11
//!
//! # Byzantine Tolerance
//!
//! A Byzantine neighbor can sign anything, but:
//! - Each binding requires BOTH signatures (neighbor + bound node)
//! - Byzantine can only contribute its own port signatures
//! - Cannot forge honest neighbors' acknowledgments
//! - With 6 Byzantine out of 20, honest node still has 14 > 11 potential bindings
